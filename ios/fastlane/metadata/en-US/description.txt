Forest Watcher is a mobile application designed to bring the dynamic online forest monitoring and alert systems of Global Forest Watch (GFW) offline and into the field. Forest Watcher allows users to easily access GFWâ€™s forest change data on any mobile device, navigate to areas of detected change, and collect information about what they find, regardless of connectivity.

This app provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution to quickly identify areas for patrols or field investigations; collect evidence about forest changes from the ground; use data collected to make evidence-based management and conservation decisions, and validate remote sensing products in the field.
