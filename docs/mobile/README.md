# Forest Watcher 2.0

Forest Watcher is a mobile application that helps people report or verify deforestation activity in the field using their smartphone.


[Forest Watcher](https://github.com/Vizzuality/forest-watcher) is using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as tech base; we strongly recommend going to their repository and follow the instructions on the [getting started](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#getting-started) section.
